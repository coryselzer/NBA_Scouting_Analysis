# NBA Scouting Analysis

## Overview 

In our pursuit of a competitive edge, we have developed two comprehensive NBA analysis dashboards using a combination of basketball expertise and data science. These dashboards, crafted through the integration of NBA_API, Jupyter notebooks, and Tableau, aim to empower our players with tactical advantages by providing in-depth insights into opponents' playing styles and tendencies. Our goal is to optimize player matchups, refine game strategies, and ultimately elevate our team's competitive performance.

## Data Sources

Utilizing the [NBA_API](https://github.com/swar/nba_api/tree/master), we gathered roster and team data for our visualizations in Tableau and machine learning models. The code and data can be found in files within our repository's NBA API/Data folder.

## Data Collection

Our data collection process involved selecting relevant datasets and performing extensive cleaning to extract only the most pertinent information. With a focus on precision, we created a data frame for API calls, enabling us to pull specific data for predicting player statistics in chosen games.

## Technologies Used

- **Jupyter Notebook:** Employed for creating our machine learning model and generating dataframes.
- **Tableau:** Utilized to design our visualization dashboards.
- **Machine Learning Model:** Provided predictive analytics for specific players and teams.

Our Tableau dashboards include comprehensive team scouting, records, and further analysis, as well as player analysis, stats, and comparisons. These tools are designed to provide a holistic view of our team's performance, enhancing our ability to make informed decisions and strategize effectively on and off the court.

## Conclusion

Through the fusion of basketball expertise, data science, and advanced technologies, our NBA Scouting Analysis project equips teams with powerful tools for strategic decision-making. Whether it's optimizing player matchups, refining game strategies, or gaining insights from predictive analytics, our comprehensive approach aims to enhance our team's competitive edge. We believe these dashboards will serve as valuable assets in the pursuit of success on the basketball court.
