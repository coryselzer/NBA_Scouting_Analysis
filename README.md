# NBA_Scouting_Analysis

Overview 

Our goal is to craft comprehensive scouting reports that empower our players with a tactical advantage, fostering a deep understanding of our adversaries' playing styles and tendencies. Through the fusion of basketball expertise and data science, we strive to optimize player matchups, refine game strategies, and ultimately enhance our team's competitive edge. 


Data Sources

We used NBA_API to gather our roster and team data that we used to create our visualizations in tableau and in our Machine Learning Model.


Data Collection

Once datasets were selected, extensive data cleaning was necessary to include only the most pertinent information. Once the data was collected and cleaned, we created a data frame where we would create our API calls. This allowed us to pull certain data from our dataframes created to predict player statistics on specific games of our choosing. 


Technologies Used

Jupyter notebook to create our Machine Learning Model and create our dataframes
Tableau to create our visualizations
Machine Learning Model to get predictive analytics for specific players and teams
