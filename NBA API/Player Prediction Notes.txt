NBA Player Point Prediction

Goal: Predict how many points Maxey will score next game vs Hawks

DF1: Player_Name | Game_ID | Home | Pts | Vs_Opp
DF2: Team_Name | Game_ID | Pts_Allowed | Pts_Allowed_vs_Players_Position | Home | Vs_Players_Team

Sample Data:
	- Player_Name: "Tyrese Maxey"
	- Game_ID: 220304
	- Home: 0	# 0 for home, 1 for away
	- Pts: 23
	- Vs_Opp: 1	# 0 for yes (vs Hawks or team in question), 1 for no

	- Team_Name: "Atl Hawks"
	- Pts_Allowed: 113
	- Pts_Allowed_vs_Players_Position: 32 	#32 points to opposing PG's that game
	- Home: 1	
	- Vs_Players_Team: 0	# 0 for yes (vs Sixers or players team in question), 1 for other teams

Training Set = points
Feature Set = everything else

Notes:
	- two dataframes won't work
	- merge into one; maybe like:
		- Player_Name | Game_ID | Home | Pts | Team_Name | Vs_Opp | Pts_Allowed | Pts_Allowed_vs_Players_Position
		- Sample Data:
			- Player_Name: "Tyrese Maxey"
			- Game_ID: 220304
			- Home: 0			# home game
			- Pts: 23			# scored by maxey
			- Team_Name: "Bos Celtics"
			- Vs_Opp: 1			# no, not vs hawks
			- Pts_Allowed: 121
			- Pts_Allowed_vs_Players_Position: 28
	- add a higher weight on games maxey plays the team in question (i.e. vs Hawks = 0 other = 1)
